Welcome to the Botania-1.7.10 repository. This is NOT the original Botania
1.7.10 repository, but a fork of it. This fork primarily exists to backport many
of the new assets created by [@artemisSystem](https://github.com/artemisSystem).
The original source can be found [here](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Botania).

Botania is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod based on adding natural
magic to the game. It's inspired by other magic mods, such as [Thaumcraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2011841-) or [Blood Magic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1899223-).
